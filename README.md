# Oscillator Network Synchronization

This interactive webpage demonstrates a network of oscillators that gradually synchronize. You can choose the number of oscillators and the connection probability, then watch the phases converge.

## How to Run

- **Live Demo**: [Click here](https://galenwilkerson.github.io/oscillator_network.html) to open the simulation directly in your browser.
- **Local**: Clone this repository, open `oscillator_network.html` in your browser, select the parameters, and click **Initialize** to start.

## Features
- Random adjacency matrix with adjustable connection probability.
- Oscillators (nodes) placed in a circle, colored by phase.
- Kuramoto-like update rule in discrete time steps.
- Watch as the network synchronizes in real-time.

Feel free to modify the parameters in the HTML code (e.g., time step `dt`, coupling strength) to explore different dynamics.
